# Expresso

Expresso is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to quickly generate ExpressJS projects with a predefined structure. It helps standardize your projects and allows you to get started quickly with a ready-to-use configuration.

## Installation

To install Expresso globally on your machine, use npm:

```sh
npm install -g @byzard/expresso
```

## Usage

To create a new ExpressJS project with Expresso, use the following command:

```sh
expresso new myapp
```

This command will create a new folder named `myapp`

```bat
myapp/
```

To see available commands, use the following command:

```sh
expresso help
```

or

```sh
expresso
```

After creating a new project, you can navigate to the project folder and install the dependencies:

```sh
cd myapp
npm install
```

To start the ExpressJS server, use the following command:

```sh
npm start
```
